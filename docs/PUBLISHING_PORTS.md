1. Create your feature branch:
    ```js
    git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-app
    ```
2.  Build only your port:
    ```js
    yarn build only my-awesome-app
    ```
3. Add, commit and send your changes:
    ```js
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat(port): add my-awesome-app"
    git push origin feat/my-awesome-app
    ```
4. Now, on GitHub, start the Pull Request creation and in the body of the pull request do the following things:
    - Put a link to the icon of the app that your port is related to
    - Attach a screenshot with a good zoom in fullscreen showing your port in action
5. Create the pull request

Yay! That's it!
